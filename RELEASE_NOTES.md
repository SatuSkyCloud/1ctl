# Release Notes

## Version 0.1.8 (17-06-2025)

### ✨ New Features
- **Machine Marketplace Discovery**: Added `machine available` command to browse and filter available machines for rent
  - Comprehensive filtering options: `--region`, `--zone`, `--min-cpu`, `--min-memory`, `--gpu`, `--recommended`, `--pricing-tier`
  - Enhanced display with pricing information, performance metrics, and recommendation indicators
  - Real-time availability status and resource specifications

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- **Updated Machine Model**: Synchronized frontend Machine model with enhanced backend structure
  - Changed `MachineID` from `uuid.UUID` to `string` type
  - Added new fields: `ID`, `Status`, `LastHealthCheck`, `Recommended`, `ResourceScore`
  - Added performance metrics: `CPUUsagePercent`, `MemoryUsagePercent`, `StorageUsagePercent`, `NetworkUsageGbps`
  - Added hardware features: `HasGPU`, `HasHDD`, `HasNVME`, `NodeType`
  - Added pricing information: `PricingTier`, `HourlyCost`
  - Added reliability metrics: `UptimePercent`, `ResponseTimeMs`, `NetworkMetricsType`

- **Enhanced Hostname Mapping**: Updated deployment logic to use machine IDs instead of machine names
  - Both manual machine selection (`--machine` flag) and automatic selection now use machine IDs
  - Improved deduplication logic based on unique machine IDs
  - Ensures consistent backend integration with machine ID-based deployments

- **Improved Machine Information Display**: Enhanced machine listing with additional useful information
  - Added Status, Node Type, Pricing Tier, and Hourly Cost to machine details
  - Added conditional display of Resource Score and Uptime percentage
  - Separate optimized display format for available machines marketplace

### 🛠️ API Enhancements
- Added `GetAvailableMachines()` API function for fetching monetized machines
- Updated `MachineIDs` struct to use string array instead of UUID array

## Version 0.1.7 (12-06-2025)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Fixed hostname deduplication for monetized machines**: When multiple machines share the same hostname (e.g., "1"), the system now properly preserves the original hostname instead of incrementing it (e.g., "1" stays "1" instead of becoming "2")
  - Added hostname deduplication logic for owner's machines in automatic selection
  - Added hostname deduplication logic for manually specified machines via `--machine` flag
  - Ensures consistent hostname behavior across both user-owned and monetized machine deployments

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- **Enhanced versioning system**: Fixed automatic version detection in build process
  - Updated `Taskfile.yml` to automatically detect version from Git tags instead of using hardcoded default
  - Added `task version` command to easily check current version information
  - Version now correctly reflects Git state with format like `v0.1.6-3-g94b0eb5` for commits ahead of tags
  - Improved build-time version injection with commit hash and build date

## Version 0.1.6 (22-03-2025)

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- Version number fix only, no functional changes

## Version 0.1.5 (22-03-2025)

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- Updated API endpoints for better resource management:
  - Fix secret and environment creation endpoints from `/create` to `upsert`
- Enforced minimum replica count for deployments (monetized).

## Version 0.1.4 (18-03-2025)

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- Improved machine allocation system:
  - Automatic machine assignment if no specific hostnames provided
  - System now intelligently selects the most cost-effective machine based on resource requirements
- Enhanced hostname selection logic:
  - Prioritizes user-owned machines first
  - Falls back to monetized machines with automatic selection
  - Improved error handling for machine allocation

## Version 0.1.3 (17-01-2025)

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- Introduced centralized error handling with `utils.NewError`
- Standardized error formatting across the codebase
- Improved error messages with better context and readability
- Added consistent error wrapping pattern
- Enhanced error handling in cleanup operations

## Version 0.1.2 (13-01-2025)

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- Updated registry URL to use the new registry

## Version 0.1.1 (04-01-2025)

### 🔒 Security Improvements

- Added safe integer conversion handling to prevent overflows in port and replica configurations
- Enhanced path validation for file operations to prevent directory traversal attacks
- Improved Docker build input validation with tag format checking
- Implemented secure file permission handling (0750 for directories, 0600 for files)
- Added protection against command injection in Docker build operations
- Better error handling in cleanup operations for test utilities

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

- Introduced `SafeInt32` utility function for safe integer conversions
- Added path validation functions in Docker and context operations
- Enhanced error handling in file operations
- Improved input validation for Docker build options
